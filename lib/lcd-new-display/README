FUNCTIONS
-clear_display()-> no arguments, just clears screen.
-menu_display()-> 
    arguments:
        -cursor -> enum from Game-services, contains information about hoovered position
        -dbl_in -> bool that tells us if double in is selected or not
        -dbl_out -> bool that tells us if double out is selected or not
        -players -> int (i'm not sure, but isn't uint8_t better here?) that tells us what is the number of players.
        * I need one more argument that gives me number of points, please do that

    This function prints menu with given information. There's three states
    of displaying one thing, one is when cursor is not hoovering over given position (black background, white text),
    when it is hoovering over given position (light blue background, black text), and a state where position is selected 
    to make changes (yellow background, black text).
-score_display() ->
    arguments:
        -nickname -> string that contains information about player nick. It is later converted into const char* which is the only way lcd is able to print it on screen. 
        -score -> It's just current number of points that given player needs to win.
        -attempts -> number of remaining attempts this round.
    This function prints current player score on screen.
-select() -> no arguments, just switching selection from true to false or from false to true.
-other functions will be described if added.


TODO
Remember to add POINTS to cursor enum and everything connected with this thing.
I think changing number of points that player needs to get in order to win is pretty important.
Make select and changing value functions work properly with
game services (if you need them, if you are changing it somewhere else, comment them and ignore), I don't think you need go_back, scroll_down or scroll_up functions, but if you do, just make them work with game services.
Check if nick is properly transformed from string -> const char*
Check if there's no problems with current_pos -> cursor change (you 
have to apply those changes to changing value functions).

I'm not sure if there's a need of clear_display function since there's a function
clearScreen but i think it's prettier with it.

Don't touch commented functions print_main_menu and print_menu_temp,
those are not required for now. Same with logo.

Keep in mind there's three states of displaying one thing, one is when cursor is not hoovering over given position (black background, white text),
when it is hoovering over given position (light blue background, black text), and a state where position is selected 
to make changes (yellow background, black text).

You can use win_animation function if you want, but it's not important.

PS. If you need more info/help call me on my phone not mess.
